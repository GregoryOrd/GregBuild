1) Make sure GregBuild only uses the .o files that it needs from the toolkit lib
    directory
2) Check for dist directory in the ExampleSrcRepo. If it does not exist, create it before trying to put the final executable 
inside of it.
3) Give ability to swap out compilers
    - Improved idea/understanding:
        - To run the tests, we need to compile the TestProject.cll and TestMain executable
        for the host system. Thus we will still use the "host" compiler (currently gcc)
        - Then if we are building for a different target hardware, we need to compile
        with an appropriate compiler for that target (avr-gcc for example)
        - So we need capability to tell if we are building for the "host" hardware
        or a "non-host target" hardware
        - Then, we want to capability to swap out both the "host" compiler and the "target"
        compiler.
4) Add ability to use certain compiler flags during both the host and target
    compliter build sequence steps
5) Use linked list implementation of CommandLineOptionList to support
    plugins adding command line options
6) Implement plugin-loader and plugin-api
7) Get a code formatter for this repo
8) Correct Test Finder so the comments in the test line can still be recognized 
   as a test case
9) Add in tests for the toolkit
10) Add tests to this repo.
    - Use an earlier version of GregBuild and GregTest to write tests for
      future development of GregBuild and GregTest
    - Introduce some chickens and some eggs, then hope things don't get too weird with that
        - LOL :)
11) Investigate multithreaded approach for execution of test cases
    a) Figure out when the dataset is large enough that multithreading is worth it
    b) Implement logic to swtich between single and multithreaded approach based on this information
12) Can we also use a multithreaded solution for gathering the test and source files?
    a) Split the subdirectories from the top level?
    b) Each thread does a recursion starting from a second level directory and working in?
13) Add logic to check if a module has been changed since it was last build. Only build modules that have been modified.
14) Verify support for different platforms
