1) Move the forkAndRunChildProcess() function from GregBuildMain.h/.c to commandLineCalls/ExternalProgramExecution.h/.c
2) Check for dist directory in the ExampleSrcRepo. If it does not exist, create it before trying to put the final executable 
inside of it.
3) Look to see if GregBuildMain can reasonable be split. It is starting to get a little big.
