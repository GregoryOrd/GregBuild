1) Implement plugin-loader and plugin-api
2) Use wildcards inside Makefile
3) Check for dist directory in the ExampleSrcRepo. If it does not exist, create it before trying to put the final executable 
inside of it.
4) Get a code formatter for this repo
5) Investigate multithreaded approach for execution of test cases
    a) Figure out when the dataset is large enough that multithreading is worth it
    b) Implement logic to swtich between single and multithreaded approach based on this information
6) Can we also use a multithreaded solution for gathering the test and source files?
    a) Split the subdirectories from the top level?
    b) Each thread does a recursion starting from a second level directory and working in?
7) Add logic to check if a module has been changed since it was last build. Only build modules that have been modified.
8) Verify support for different platforms
